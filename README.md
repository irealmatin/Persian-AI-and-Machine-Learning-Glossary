# Persian-AI-and-Machine-Learning-Glossary
Suggested Persian equivalents words for technical words in AI and ML

## Introduction
Welcome to the Persian AI and Machine Learning Glossary repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of Persian translations for technical terms and concepts in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our goal is to facilitate better communication and understanding of these complex topics for Persian-speaking learners, researchers, and practitioners.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a collaborative platform for the AI and machine learning community to share, discuss, and refine translations of technical terms and concepts in Persian. By creating a centralized glossary, we hope to standardize terminology and improve the accessibility of resources for Persian speakers in this rapidly evolving domain.

## How To Use
You can use this glossary as a reference when reading or writing about AI and machine learning in Persian. To find a translation for a specific term, simply browse the repository or use the search functionality to locate the term and its corresponding Persian translation.

## Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to this project by suggesting new terms, providing translations, or refining existing translations. Your contributions will help make this glossary more comprehensive and valuable for the Persian-speaking AI and machine learning community. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., add-term-xyz or refine-translation-abc).
3. Add your suggested term(s) and/or translation(s) to the appropriate file(s) (only the **Glossary.yaml** file which is not sorted) or create a new file if necessary.
4. Commit your changes with a clear and concise message describing your contribution.
5. Create a pull request, explaining the changes you've made and their importance.

When suggesting a new term or translation, please ensure that it is relevant to the field of AI and machine learning, and that the translation is accurate and clear. We appreciate your help in maintaining the quality and consistency of the glossary.

## Feedback and Suggestions
If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to us through the repository's discussions section. We value your input and look forward to collaborating with you on this project.

**Let's work together to make AI and machine learning more accessible to the Persian-speaking community!**
