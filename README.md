# Persian-AI-and-Machine-Learning-Glossary

## Introduction

Welcome to the Persian AI and Machine Learning Glossary repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of Persian translations for technical terms and concepts in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our goal is to facilitate better communication and understanding of these complex topics for Persian-speaking learners, researchers, and practitioners.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collaborative platform for the AI and machine learning community to share, discuss, and refine translations of technical terms and concepts in Persian. By creating a centralized glossary, we hope to standardize terminology and improve the accessibility of resources for Persian speakers in this rapidly evolving domain.

## How to Use

You can use this glossary as a reference when reading or writing about AI and machine learning in Persian. To find a translation for a specific term, simply browse the repository or use the search functionality to locate the term and its corresponding Persian translation.

## Features

![Screenshot](images/Screenshot.png)

This web app offers a user-friendly interface to search for English terms and find their Persian translations. The current features include:

- **Searching English terms**: Users can search for English terms, and if the term is not found in the dictionary, the search algorithm will attempt to find the most similar match. This feature is particularly useful when the user misspells a query.

- **Displaying multiple translations**: If there are multiple translations available for a term, they will be shown in the order of their ratings, with the highest-rated translations displayed first. This helps users find the most accurate translations quickly and easily.

- **Rating existing translations**: Users can rate the existing translations, helping improve the quality of the translations shown in future searches.

- **Adding new translations for existing terms**: Users can provide new translations for existing terms, contributing to the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the dictionary.

- **Adding new terms and their translations**: Users can add new terms and their translations to the dictionary, helping expand the dictionary's coverage of English-Persian translations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! You can contribute to this project by visiting the deployed web app and following these steps. Your contributions will help make this glossary more comprehensive and valuable for the Persian-speaking AI and machine learning community.

1. **Rating existing translations**: Browse the dictionary and rate the translations you find. Your ratings will help improve the quality of the translations shown in future searches.

2. **Adding new translations for existing terms**: If you find a term that has no translation or you believe you can provide a better translation, please feel free to add your suggestion. Your contribution will be reviewed, and if approved, it will be added to the dictionary.

3. **Adding new terms and their corresponding translations**: If you come across a term that is not present in the dictionary, you can add the term along with its translation. Your submission will be reviewed, and if approved, it will be added to the dictionary.

To get started, visit the [deployed web app](your_web_app_link_here) and start contributing. Thank you for your support!

When suggesting a new term or translation, please ensure that it is relevant to the field of AI and machine learning, and that the translation is accurate and clear. We appreciate your help in maintaining the quality and consistency of the glossary.

## Feedback and Suggestions

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to us through the repository's discussions section. We value your input and look forward to collaborating with you on this project.
